Codility Question: https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/frog_river_one/

Given an array of integers A and an integer X, find the earliest time that the frog can get across the river.
The frog can only cross the river if there is a leaf in each position between its start point (X=0) and its destination X.

Solution runs in O(N) time and O(X) space complexity.
